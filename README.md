Musicana.
Hey there, it's a music player built on python 3.6 by using tkinter gui and pygame module(although many other modules are also used but it's the main module which is helpful in manipulating and processing music files).

It's a simple music player , and i have tried to provide it all the neccessary features and there are many other features which i will implement in this project in future.

Features:
Play
Pause
Resume
Play next/previous
Stop music
Select file or folder either of the two.
Mute/Unmute
Volume controller slider
And many more

Future expected updates:
Forward/backward using slider.
New Themes
Shuffle
Queue of songs(your own queue)
Search

Steps to run the app on your system.
(I have already provided the .py file to help you with code)
Download and unzip the file Music_Player_version-1.0 and click on the Musicana, to Enter Nirvana.(You'll get all the resources and icon in the same).
